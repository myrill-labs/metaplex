          'Myrmidons is a collection of unique generated trading bot stored on the Solana blockchain.',
          'Once a bot has been designed and trained, we associate a Non-Fungible Token (NFT) to it. We call it Myrmidon. We develop a Dapp to manage and store it. The Dapp interacts with the Solana blockchain, and we are working exclusively with the smart contracts to guarantee verified data. The NFT certifies several properties of the bot:\n' +
          '\n',
          '• Ownership. The NFT is linked to the public address of the creator and can be sold on Myrill’s marketplace.\n',
          '• Statistical Model and meta-parameters checksum. The data itself is stored on Solana and thus cannot be modified any longer.\n',
          '• Performances. We record on the blockchain simulation performances, and the bot’s trades during live trading.\n',
          'This certification mechanism unlocks a market for true and unaltered trading bots. This way, users can rent, buy, or invest into myrmidons without having to worry about scam and performance issues.',
          'We are selling 100 myrmidons NFT, 10 each week from October to January. Each myrmidon unlocks several perks:\n',
          '• unique access to a pre-configured and pre-trained bot.\n' ,
          '• early access to the no-code platform.\n',
          '• access to the restricted slack with direct support from ML engineers, quants and traders.',
          'Each myrmidon has a unique investor profile. Some will trade only on Coinbase, some will use alternative data, some will do market making etc.',
          'Myrmidon#1 will be the first to be available for live trading in June 2022, then others will be release each month from June 2022 to May 2023.'
